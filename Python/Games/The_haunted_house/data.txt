# Full name: Duyen Ngoc Ky Nguyen

# The chosen format is "Area_name:Area_Description:Exit_direction_to_the_North:Exit_direction_to_the_South:Exit_direction_to_the_West:Exit_direction_to_the_East:Location_Upstairs:Location_Downstairs:Object_name:Object_Description"
# Reason for choosing it: 
# Firstly, using this ":" will allow me to read and split the data into the memory easily as separate categories.
# Secondly, to easily implement the code later, I decided that each room has a maximum of 1 object. Hence there will be 10 areas without any objects, and I will fill all related information regarding the object in those areas as "None". 
# Thirdly, each area can have a maximum of 4 neighbouring areas and some will have less. Thus, I would fill it as "None" if the neighbouring area in a specific direction doesn't exist.
# Last but not least, some areas can be located next to upstairs and downstairs. I will also fill "None" for the areas when they aren't located next to the stairs.

# In order to complete the game: The player must explore all 20 areas and examine enough 10 objects.
# The actual descriptions of each room, object, and exit is as follow:
